# Etch-a-Sketch

This is the second project of the Odin Project JavaScript course which displays the skills I have learnt with using DOM manipulation and event listeners to create a replica of an etch-a-sketch.

The design is very minimal and easy on the eye with built in features to help if the grid is hard to look at. Layout is created with flexbox.
